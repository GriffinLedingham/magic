node-web-app
============

A basic node web app set up with express and socket.io.

Running:
```
  node server.js
```

Will begin the node server, serving up the client directory over port 3000.

The current version of the app can be found at:

```
http://mtgfish.herokuapp.com/
```

This is a very in-progress state of the app, but a number of cards are working as intended.

Use SPACE to advance through the phases, normal rules apply as far as which cards may be played when.

To add generic mana to the pool, click on a colored mana symbol, which has mana floating to convert it to generic to fulfil a generic cost.

(If the deck is drawn through, roughly 30 cards, the test environment will like have issues.)
